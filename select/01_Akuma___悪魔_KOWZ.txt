We said a lot of words that we can't take back,
And I tried to put us first but we came out last
The truth is, I think that this is deeper than us
Maybe we just love the idea of being in love.
Swimming in troubled waters but I'm drowning in the lies,
And searching for the truth, all I found is our demise.
Our love was made of glass, I'm trying to pick up every piece.
Waving a white flag, I just need a little peace.
First you hate me, then you love me, then you hate me more,
No, I gave you lots of ammunition cause our love was war,
We keep breaking up and making up, I mean, that's what we are
Going 'round in circles like we're stuck in a revolving door.
A revolving door - A revolving door
- A revolving door - A revolving door.
(Breaking up and making up, I mean, that's what we are)
(Going 'round in circles like we're stuck in a revolving door.)

Round in circles like we're stuck in a revolving door.

(Yeah)

(Let's go)
(Huh.)
